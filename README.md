In this project I have tried to ,do some data exploration steps like:
1. Tracking the amount spent per transaction of all the 50 million female customers, and all the 50 million male customers, calculate the average, and conclude the results.
2. Talking Inference after computing the average female and male expenses.
3. Using the sample average to find out an interval within which the population average will lie. Using the sample of female customers you will calculate the interval within which the average spending of 50 million male and female customers may lie.
